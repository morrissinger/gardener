A WIP demonstrating driving [Atlas Scientific](http://www.atlas-scientific.com/) [Industrial pH sensor](http://www.atlas-scientific.com/product_pages/probes/industrial_ph_probe.html) and [EC sensors](http://www.atlas-scientific.com/product_pages/kits/ec_k0_1_kit.html) through a single Arduino via Atlas's [EZO pH circuit](http://www.atlas-scientific.com/product_pages/circuits/ezo_ph.html) and [EZO EC circuit](http://www.atlas-scientific.com/product_pages/circuits/ezo_ec.html). There is cruft in here, as it was a very quick pass to 
get the job done.
